DP: programs in computer science are written to optimize some value; for example, find the shortest path between two points, find the line that best fits a set of points, or find the smallest set of objects that satisfies some criteria.

Binary Search alwasys compare to next one
Suppose you have the following sorted list [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18] and are using the recursive binary search algorithm. Which group of numbers correctly shows the sequence of comparisons used to search for the key 16?

12, 17, 15


Sort Algorithm
Bubble Sort
1. Slow way: two for loop to check each item Complexity: ![first equation]http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1567921444/render.png
2. Fast way: using while and for loop (if list[i] > list[i+1], we record an exchange and continue)and if in one iteration, nothing changed, we stop loop.
