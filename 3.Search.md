## Search Algorithm

<details>
    <summary>Binary Search</summary>
A binary search of an ordered list is 𝑂(log𝑛) in the worst case.   
Binary Search always compare to next one   
Suppose you have the following sorted list [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18] and are using the recursive binary search algorithm. Which group of numbers correctly shows the sequence of comparisons used to search for the key 16?  
12, 17, 15

A sequential search is 𝑂(𝑛) for ordered and unordered lists.

### Hash Tables
Hash tables can provide constant time searching.  

<details>
    <summary>Collision Resolution and Linear</summary>

When two items hash to the same slot, we must have a systematic method for placing the second item in the hash table. This process is called __collision resolution__ .

    <summary>Linear</summary>

    <summary>Deletion in a Hash table</summary>

When we delete hash table, if doing hash searching, we have to add "-1" into slot not just delete values in slot

    <summary>Prove of probed slot</summary>
we can prove that this will always be the case: suppose that  𝑖∈{1,…,𝑛} , and let  𝑖2≡𝑐(mod𝑛)  (in our example,  𝑐=3 ). Then
(𝑖+𝑘𝑛)2=𝑖2+2𝑖𝑘𝑛+(𝑘𝑛)2≡𝑖2(mod𝑛)≡𝑐(mod𝑛) 
since  2𝑖𝑘𝑛  and  (𝑘𝑛)2  are both divisible by  𝑛 . So it is pointless to iterate past  𝑛 , as we will keep probing the same slots!  

Can we now prove that not all slots will be probed?  

Yes! Just observe that for  𝑖∈{1,…,𝑛}  we have:  

* i^2≡𝑐(mod𝑛) 
* (𝑛−𝑖)2=𝑛2−2𝑖𝑛+𝑖2≡𝑐(mod𝑛)
This means that if we iterate over the first half of the range  {1,…,𝑛} , we will probe the same slots as if we iterate over the second half  
```python
n=97 #don't put 2
halves = [range(1, (n+1)//2), range((n+1)//2, n)]
skips = []
for half in halves:
    slots = set()
    for i in half:
        slots.add((i**2)%n)
    print(slots)
    skips.append(slots)
assert skips[0]==skips[1]
```
