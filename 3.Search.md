### Binary Search 
A binary search of an ordered list is 𝑂(log𝑛) in the worst case.
Binary Search always compare to next one
Suppose you have the following sorted list [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18] and are using the recursive binary search algorithm. Which group of numbers correctly shows the sequence of comparisons used to search for the key 16?
12, 17, 15

### sequential search
A sequential search is 𝑂(𝑛) for ordered and unordered lists.


### Hash tables 
Hash tables can provide constant time searching.
